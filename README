Scope:

Many programming languages implement scope for variables – and they are context sensitive. For example a global scope variable will be over-ridden using local variable definition. You need to implement simple interpreter which tells us current value of a variable, if its not defined then value should be zero, Input will start with ‘[‘ and will end with matching ‘]’

Sample Input:
[
a 10
print a
b 20
[
a 10
print a 
print b
b 23
print b
b a
print b
b 23
]
print a
print b
print c
]

Sample output
10
10
20
23

0

Sample Input
[
print a
]
Sample Output
